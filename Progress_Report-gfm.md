# Project Progress Reports

**Entry 1: October 7th, 2025**

I have refined my research questions and widened my data pool to include
all of the songs on the four albums I chose to analyze. This will make
for a hopefully more rich data pool and just generally provide more to
look at. I also found some packages I can try out to help me identify
the Korean versus English words in the lyrics; **textcat** package or
the **cldr** package. I am not sure which works best for my purposes but
plan to look into the exact functions on each as I start the actual
coding process.

I set up the repository and provided a more detailed plan of my project.
I only really had one idea for a project, so I didn’t have to spend time
on choosing a direction. The ‘license’ and ‘read me’ files are
established and can be added to later.

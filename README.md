**Summary**

This project analyzes the language choice of popular Korean artists over time as their popularity and industry success increases. Albums from popular group, Seventeen, were observed for Korean versus English usage in the lyrics of the songs as well as their place in the structure of each song. The project aims to observe whether the artists adapt their language choice (Korean vs. English) depending on their rising popularity. Moreover, the question of whether popularity (album sales) has any correlation to language use (Korean vs. English lyrics) is addressed.
